# Conty Install

Conty is a rootless cointainer for running wine/mono based programs

PTMuxer can use Conty to run eac3to and bdinfo in enviroments without wine or mono

The download is 1.7GB so if you have any access to root, then it might be better to install mono/wine or for example a Docker Container to save space\
