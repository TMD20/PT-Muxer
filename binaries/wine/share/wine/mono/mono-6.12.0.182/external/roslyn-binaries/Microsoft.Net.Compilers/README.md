# Microsoft.Net.Compilers

Extracted nuget packages of Microsoft.Net.Compilers. Older versions should not be removed as they are used for bisecting and compatibility testing. Newer versions are not always from NuGet and may be experimental from-source builds of Roslyn.

> nuget install Microsoft.Net.Compilers
