 Software Grant License Agreement ("Agreement")
 .
 Except for the license granted herein to you, ARM Limited ("ARM") reserves all
 right, title, and interest in and to the Software (defined below).
 .
 Definition
 .
 "Software" means the code and documentation as well as any original work of
 authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
 is intentionally submitted by ARM to llvm.org (http://llvm.org) ("LLVM") for
 inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by LLVM
 (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
 electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to LLVM or its
 representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
 mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
 managed by, or on behalf of, LLVM for the purpose of discussing and improving
 the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked otherwise.
 .
 1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, ARM hereby grants to you and to recipients of the Software
    distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
    works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Software and such derivative works.
 .
 2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, ARM hereby grants you and to recipients of the Software
    distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
    to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by ARM that are necessarily infringed by ARM's Software alone or by
    combination of the Software with the Work to which such Software was
    submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against ARM or any
    other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
    that ARM's Software, or the Work to which ARM has contributed constitutes
    direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
    to that entity under this Agreement for the Software or Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the software is
 provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
 either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
 conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
