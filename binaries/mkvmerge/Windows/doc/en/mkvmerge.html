                              have to be listed after the <span class="literal">parts:</span> keyword and be separated by commas. A range itself consists of a start and an
                              end timestamp in the same format the other variations of <span class="parameter">--split</span> accept (e.g. both

                              If a start timestamp is left out then it defaults to the previous range's end timestamp.
                              If there was no previous range then it
                              defaults to the start of the file (see example 3).

                              Normally each range will be written to a new file. This can be changed so that consecutive
                              ranges are written to the same file. For
                              that the user has to prefix the start timestamp with a <span class="literal">+</span>. This tells <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) not to create a new file and
                              instead append the range to the same file the previous range was written to. Timestamps
                              will be adjusted so that there will be no
                              gap in the output file even if there was a gap in the two ranges in the input file.

                              The <span class="literal">parts-frames</span> mode tells <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) to keep certain ranges of frame/field numbers while discarding
                              others. The ranges to keep have to be listed after the <span class="literal">parts-frames:</span> keyword and be separated by commas. A range
                              itself consists of a start and an end frame/field number. Numbering starts at 1.

                              If a start number is left out then it defaults to the previous range's end number.
                              If there was no previous range then it defaults
                              to the start of the file (see example 3).

                              If an end number is left out then it defaults to the end of the source files which
                              basically tells <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) to keep the rest (see

                              Normally each range will be written to a new file. This can be changed so that consecutive
                              ranges are written to the same file. For
                              that the user has to prefix the start number with a <span class="literal">+</span>. This tells <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) not to create a new file and
                              instead append the range to the same file the previous range was written to. Timestamps
                              will be adjusted so that there will be no
                              gap in the output file even if there was a gap in the two ranges in the input file.

                                 block contains either a full frame (for progressive content) or a single field (for
                                 interlaced content).  mkvmerge does not
                                 distinguish between those two and simply counts the number of blocks.  For example:
                                 If one wanted to split after the 25th full
                                 frame with interlaced content one would have to use <span class="literal">50</span> (two fields per full frame) as the split point.

                                 The numbers given with this argument are interpreted based on the number of <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> blocks that are output.  A single <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup>
                                 block contains either a full frame (for progressive content) or a single field (for
                                 interlaced content).  mkvmerge does not
                                 distinguish between those two and simply counts the number of blocks.  For example:
                                 If one wanted to split after the 25th full
                                 frame with interlaced content one would have to use <span class="literal">50</span> (two fields per full frame) as the split point.

                              Numbering starts at 1.  The list of chapter numbers is separated by commas.  Splitting
                              will occur right before the first key frame
                              whose timestamp is equal to or bigger than the start timestamp for the chapters whose
                              numbers are listed.  A chapter starting at 0s
                              is never considered for splitting and discarded silently.

                                 The <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file format supports arbitrary deeply nested chapter structures called 'edition entries'
                                 and 'chapter atoms'.
                                 However, this mode only considers the top-most level of chapters across all edition
                                 entries.

                     <p>
                        For this splitting mode the output filename is treated differently than for the normal
                        operation. It may contain a
                        <span class="function">printf</span> like expression '<span class="code">%d</span>' including an optional field width,
                        e.g. '<span class="code">%02d</span>'. If it does then the current file number will be formatted appropriately and inserted
                        at that point
                        in the filename.  If there is no such pattern then a pattern of '<span class="code">-%03d</span>' is assumed right before the file's
                        extension: '<span class="code">-o output.mkv</span>' would result in '<span class="code">output-001.mkv</span>' and so on. If there's no extension
                        then '<span class="code">-%03d</span>' will be appended to the name.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>
                        Another possible pattern is '<span class="code">%c</span>' which will be replaced by the name of the first chapter in the file. Note that when
                        '<span class="code">%c</span>' is present, the pattern '<span class="code">-%03d</span>' will not be added automatically.

                        Determines how timestamps are calculated when appending files.  The parameter <span class="parameter">mode</span> can have two values:
                        '<span class="literal">file</span>' which is also the default and '<span class="literal">track</span>'.

                     <p>
                        When mkvmerge appends a track (called '<span class="literal">track2_1</span>' from now on) from a second file (called
                        '<span class="literal">file2</span>') to a track (called '<span class="literal">track1_1</span>') from the first file (called '<span class="literal">file1</span>')
                        then it has to offset all timestamps for '<span class="literal">track2_1</span>' by an amount.  For '<span class="literal">file</span>' mode this amount is
                        the highest timestamp encountered in '<span class="literal">file1</span>' even if that timestamp was from a different track than
                        '<span class="literal">track1_1</span>'. In track mode the offset is the highest timestamp of '<span class="literal">track1_1</span>'.

                     <p>
                        Unfortunately mkvmerge cannot detect which mode to use reliably. Therefore it defaults
                        to '<span class="literal">file</span>'
                        mode. '<span class="literal">file</span>' mode usually works better for files that have been created independently of each
                        other; e.g. when
                        appending <span class="abbrev">AVI</span> or <span class="abbrev">MP4</span> files. '<span class="literal">track</span>' mode may work better for sources that are
                        essentially just parts of one big file, e.g. for <span class="abbrev">VOB</span> and <span class="abbrev">EVO</span> files.

                        Subtitle tracks are always treated as if '<span class="literal">file</span>' mode were active even if '<span class="literal">track</span>' mode actually
                        is.

                        This option controls to which track another track is appended.  Each spec contains
                        four IDs: a file ID, a track ID, a second file ID
                        and a second track ID.  The first pair, "source file ID" and "source track ID", identifies
                        the track that is to be appended.  The
                        second pair, "destination file ID" and "destination track ID", identifies the track
                        the first one is appended to.

                        If this option has been omitted then a standard mapping is used.  This standard mapping
                        appends each track from the current file to a
                        track from the previous file with the same track ID.  This allows for easy appending

                        and all following files will be appended to the first file named within the brackets.

                        This is an alternative syntax to using '+' between the file names. Therefore the following

                        For certain file types (MPEG program streams = VOBs) <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) normally looks for files in the same directory as an input file that
                        have the same base name and only differ in their running number (e.g. 'VTS_01_1.VOB',
                        'VTS_01_2.VOB', 'VTS_01_3.VOB' etc) and treats
                        all of those files as if they were concatenated into a single big file. This option,
                        a single '=', causes mkvmerge not to look for
                        those additional files.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>
                        The '=' can also be put in front of the next file name. Therefore the following two
                        commands are equivalent:
                        
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        If multiple file names are contained in a pair of parenthesis then those files will
                        be treated as if they were concatenated into a
                        single big file consisting of the content of each of the files one after the other.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>
                        This can be used for e.g. VOB files coming from a DVD or MPEG transport streams. It
                        cannot be used if each file contains its own set
                        of headers which is usually the case with stand-alone files like AVI or MP4.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>
                        Putting a file name into parenthesis also prevents <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) from looking for additional files with the same base name as described
                        in <a href="#mkvmerge.description.prevent_concatenation">option =</a>. Therefore these two command lines are
                        equivalent:
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o out.mkv = file.mkv
$ mkvmerge -o out.mkv '(' file.mkv ')'</pre>
                     
                     <p>
                        Several things should be noted:
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li>
                           
                           <p>
                              There must be spaces both after the opening and before the closing parenthesis.
                              
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        
                        <li>
                           
                           <p>
                              Every parameter between parenthesis is interpreted as a file name. Therefore all options
                              applying to this logical file must be listed before the opening parenthesis.
                              
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        
                        <li>
                           
                           <p>
                              Some shells treat parenthesis as special characters. Hence you must escape or quote
                              them as shown in the example above.

                        reason for this switch is that it is technically impossible to automatically tell
                        normal <span class="abbrev">AAC</span> data from <span class="abbrev">SBR
                           AAC</span> data without decoding a complete <span class="abbrev">AAC</span> frame. As there are several patent issues with <span class="abbrev">AAC</span>
                        decoders <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) will never contain this decoding stage. So for <span class="abbrev">SBR AAC</span> files this switch is mandatory. The

                        If the source file is a <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file then the <span class="classname">CodecID</span> should be enough to detect <span class="abbrev">SBR
                           AAC</span>. However, if the <span class="classname">CodecID</span> is wrong then this switch can be used to correct that.

                        Tells the program to flush all data cached in memory to storage when closing files
                        opened for writing.
                        This can be used to prevent data loss on power outages or to circumvent certain problems
                        in the operating system or drivers.
                        The downside is that multiplexing will take longer as mkvmerge will wait until all
                        data has been written to the storage before exiting.

         <p>
            The order in which options are entered is important for some options. Options fall
            into two categories:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <ol>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>
                  Options that affect the whole program and are not tied to any input file. These include
                  but are not limited to
                  <span class="option">--command-line-charset</span>, <span class="option">--output</span> or <span class="option">--title</span>. These can appear anywhere on the
                  command line.
                  
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               
               <p>
                  Options that affect a single input file or a single track in an input file. These
                  options all apply to the following input file on the
                  command line. All options applying to the same input (or to tracks from the same input
                  file) file can be written in any order as long
                  as they all appear before that input file's name. Examples for options applying to
                  an input file are <span class="option">--no-chapters</span> or
                  <span class="option">--chapter-charset</span>. Examples for options applying to a single track are <span class="option">--default-duration</span> or
                  <span class="option">--language</span>.
                  
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p>
            The options are processed from left to right. If an option appears multiple times
            within the same scope then the last occurrence will be
            used. Therefore the title will be set to "Something else" in the following example:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o output.mkv --title 'This and that' input.avi --title 'Something else'</pre>
         
         <p>
            The following example shows that using the <span class="option">--language</span> option twice is OK because they're used in different scopes. Even
            though they apply to the same track ID they apply to different input files and therefore
            have different scopes:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o output.mkv --language 0:fre français.ogg --language 0:deu deutsch.ogg</pre>

         <p>
            Let's assume you have a file called MyMovie.avi and the audio track in a separate
            file, e.g. '<span class="literal">MyMovie.wav</span>'. First you
            want to encode the audio to <span class="productname">OggVorbis</span><sup>(tm)</sup>:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ oggenc -q4 -oMyMovie.ogg MyMovie.wav</pre>
         
         <p>
            After a couple of minutes you can join video and audio:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o MyMovie-with-sound.mkv MyMovie.avi MyMovie.ogg</pre>
         
         <p>
            If your <span class="abbrev">AVI</span> already contains an audio track then it will be copied as well (if <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) supports the audio format). To
            avoid that simply do
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o MyMovie-with-sound.mkv -A MyMovie.avi MyMovie.ogg</pre>
         
         <p>
            After some minutes of consideration you rip another audio track, e.g.  the director's
            comments or another language to
            '<span class="literal">MyMovie-add-audio.wav</span>'.  Encode it again and join it up with the other file:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ oggenc -q4 -oMyMovie-add-audio.ogg MyMovie-add-audio.wav
$ mkvmerge -o MM-complete.mkv MyMovie-with-sound.mkv MyMovie-add-audio.ogg</pre>
         
         <p>
            The same result can be achieved with
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o MM-complete.mkv -A MyMovie.avi MyMovie.ogg MyMovie-add-audio.ogg</pre>
         
         <p>
            Now fire up <span class="productname">mplayer</span><sup>(tm)</sup> and enjoy. If you have multiple audio tracks (or even video tracks) then you can
            tell
            <span class="productname">mplayer</span><sup>(tm)</sup> which track to play with the '<span class="option">-vid</span>' and '<span class="option">-aid</span>' options. These are
            0-based and do not distinguish between video and audio.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            If you need an audio track synchronized you can do that easily. First find out which
            track ID the Vorbis track has with
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge --identify outofsync.ogg</pre>
         
         <p>
            Now you can use that ID in the following command line:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o goodsync.mkv -A source.avi -y 12345:200 outofsync.ogg</pre>
         
         <p>
            This would add 200ms of silence at the beginning of the audio track with the
            ID <span class="constant">12345</span> taken from '<span class="literal">outofsync.ogg</span>'.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Some movies start synced correctly but slowly drift out of sync. For these kind of
            movies you can specify a delay factor that is applied
            to all timestamps -- no data is added or removed. So if you make that factor too big
            or too small you'll get bad results. An example is
            that an episode I transcoded was <span class="constant">0.2</span> seconds out of sync at the end of the movie which was
            <span class="constant">77340</span> frames long. At <span class="constant">29.97fps</span> <span class="constant">0.2</span> seconds correspond to
            approx. <span class="constant">6</span> frames. So I did
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o goodsync.mkv -y 23456:0,77346/77340 outofsync.mkv</pre>
         
         <p>
            The result was fine.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            The sync options can also be used for subtitles in the same manner.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            For text subtitles you can either use some Windows software (like <span class="productname">SubRipper</span><sup>(tm)</sup>) or the
            <span class="productname">subrip</span><sup>(tm)</sup> package found in
            <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/transcode"><span class="productname">transcode</span>(1)</a>'s sources in the
            '<span class="literal">contrib/subrip</span>' directory. The general process is:

               </li>

               <p>convert the text files to a SRT file:</p>
               <pre class="screen">$ srttool -s -w -i mymovie.srtx -o mymovie.srt</pre>
               </li>
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p>
            The resulting file can be used as another input file for <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1):
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o mymovie.mkv mymovie.avi mymovie.srt</pre>
         
         <p>
            If you want to specify the language for a given track then this is easily done. First
            find out the ISO 639-2 code for your
            language. <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) can list all of those codes for you:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge --list-languages</pre>
         
         <p>
            Search the list for the languages you need. Let's assume you have put two audio tracks
            into a <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file and want to set their
            language codes and that their track IDs are 2 and 3. This can be done with
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o with-lang-codes.mkv --language 2:ger --language 3:dut without-lang-codes.mkv</pre>
         
         <p>
            As you can see you can use the <a href="#mkvmerge.description.language">--language</a> switch multiple times.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Maybe you'd also like to have the player use the Dutch language as the default language.
            You also have extra subtitles, e.g. in English
            and French, and want to have the player display the French ones by default. This can
            be done with
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge -o with-lang-codes.mkv --language 2:ger --language 3:dut --default-track-flag 3 without-lang-codes.mkv --language 0:eng english.srt --default-track-flag 0 --language 0:fre french.srt</pre>

            All text in a <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file is encoded in UTF-8. This means that <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) has to convert every text file it reads as well as every
            text given on the command line from one character set into UTF-8. In return this also
            means that <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1)'s output has to be converted
            back to that character set from UTF-8, e.g. if a non-English translation is used with
            <a href="#mkvmerge.description.ui_language">--ui-language</a> or for text originating from a <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file.

         <p>
            <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) does this conversion automatically based on the presence of a byte order marker (short:
            <span class="abbrev">BOM</span>) or the system's
            current locale. How the character set is inferred from the locale depends on the operating
            system that <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) is run on.

            Text files that start with a BOM are already encoded in one representation of UTF.
            <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) supports the following five modes: UTF-8,
            UTF-16 Little and Big Endian, UTF-32 Little and Big Endian. Text files with a BOM
            are automatically converted to UTF-8. Any of the
            parameters that would otherwise set the character set for such a file (e.g. <a href="#mkvmerge.description.sub_charset">--sub-charset</a>) is silently ignored.

            On Windows the default character set used for converting text files is determined

            An option file is a file <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) can read additional command line arguments from. This can be used in order to circumvent
            certain

         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            An option file contains JSON-formatted data. Its content must be a valid JSON array
            consisting solely of JSON strings. The file's
            encoding must be UTF-8. The file should not start with a byte order marker (<span class="abbrev">BOM</span>), but if one exists, it will be skipped.

         <p>
            The rules for escaping special characters inside JSON are the ones in the official

         <p>
            <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> supports file linking which simply says that a specific file is the predecessor or
            successor of the current file. To be precise,
            it's not really the files that are linked but the <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> segments. As most files will probably only contain one <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> segment the
            following explanations use the term 'file linking' although 'segment linking' would
            be more appropriate.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Each segment is identified by a unique 128 bit wide segment UID. This UID is automatically
            generated by <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1). The linking is done
            primarily via putting the segment UIDs (short: <span class="abbrev">SID</span>) of the previous/next file into the segment header
            information. <a href="mkvinfo.html"><span class="productname">mkvinfo</span>(1)</a> prints these <span class="abbrev">SIDs</span> if it finds them.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            If a file is split into several smaller ones and linking is used then the timestamps
            will not start at 0 again but will continue where the
            last file has left off. This way the absolute time is kept even if the previous files
            are not available (e.g. when streaming). If no
            linking is used then the timestamps should start at 0 for each file. By default <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) does not use file linking. If you want that you
            can turn it on with the <span class="option">--link</span> option. This option is only useful if splitting is activated as well.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Regardless of whether splitting is active or not the user can tell <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) to link the produced files to specific
            <span class="abbrev">SIDs</span>. This is achieved with the options <span class="option">--link-to-previous</span> and <span class="option">--link-to-next</span>.  These
            options accept a segment <span class="abbrev">SID</span> in the format that <a href="mkvinfo.html"><span class="productname">mkvinfo</span>(1)</a> outputs: 16 hexadecimal numbers between
            <span class="constant">0x00</span> and <span class="constant">0xff</span> prefixed with '<span class="literal">0x</span>' each, e.g. '<span class="code">0x41 0xda 0x73 0x66
               0xd9 0xcf 0xb2 0x1e 0xae 0x78 0xeb 0xb4 0x5e 0xca 0xb3 0x93</span>'. Alternatively a shorter form can be used: 16 hexadecimal numbers
            between <span class="constant">0x00</span> and <span class="constant">0xff</span> without the '<span class="literal">0x</span>' prefixes and without the spaces, e.g.
            '<span class="code">41da7366d9cfb21eae78ebb45ecab393</span>'.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            If splitting is used then the first file is linked to the <span class="abbrev">SID</span> given with <span class="option">--link-to-previous</span> and the
            last file is linked to the <span class="abbrev">SID</span> given with <span class="option">--link-to-next</span>. If splitting is not used then the one output
            file will be linked to both of the two <span class="abbrev">SIDs</span>.

            <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) supports two kinds of chapter files as its input. The first format, called 'simple
            chapter format', is the same format that
            the <span class="abbrev">OGM</span> tools expect. The second format is a <span class="abbrev">XML</span> based chapter format which supports all of <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup>'s chapter
            functionality.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Apart from dedicated chapter files <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) can also read chapters from other file formats (e.g. MP4, Ogg, Blu-rays or DVDs).

         <p>
            This format consists of pairs of lines that start with '<span class="literal">CHAPTERxx=</span>' and '<span class="literal">CHAPTERxxNAME=</span>'
            respectively. The first one contains the start timestamp while the second one contains
            the title. Here's an example:

CHAPTER03NAME=Baby rocks the house</pre>
         
         <p>
            <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) will transform every pair or lines into one <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> <span class="classname">ChapterAtom</span>. It does not set any

         <p>
            As this is a text file character set conversion may need to be done. See the section

The chapters from all sources (<span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> files,

            <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup>'s tag system is similar to that of other containers: a set of <span class="parameter">KEY=VALUE</span> pairs. However, in <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup>
            these tags can also be nested, and both the <span class="parameter">KEY</span> and the <span class="parameter">VALUE</span> are elements of their
            own. The example file <span class="filename">example-tags-2.xml</span> shows how to use this system.

         <p>
            <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> tags do not automatically apply to the complete file. They can, but they also may
            apply to different parts of the file: to one
            or more tracks, to one or more chapters, or even to a combination of both. The <a href="https://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/index.html">Matroska specification</a> gives more details about this fact.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            One important fact is that tags are linked to tracks or chapters with the <span class="classname">Targets</span> <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> tag element, and
            that the UIDs used for this linking are <em>not</em> the track IDs <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) uses everywhere. Instead the numbers used are
            the UIDs which <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) calculates automatically (if the track is taken from a file format other than <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup>) or which are copied
            from the source file if the track's source file is a <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file. Therefore it is difficult to know which UIDs to use in the tag
            file before the file is handed over to <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1).

         <p>
            <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) knows two options with which you can add tags to <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> files: The <a href="#mkvmerge.description.global_tags">--global-tags</a> and the <a href="#mkvmerge.description.tags">--tags</a> options. The difference is that the former option, <a href="#mkvmerge.description.global_tags">--global-tags</a>, will make the tags apply to the complete file by
            removing any of those <span class="classname">Targets</span> elements mentioned above.  The latter option, <a href="#mkvmerge.description.tags">--tags</a>, automatically inserts the UID that <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) generates for the tag
            specified with the <span class="parameter">TID</span> part of the <a href="#mkvmerge.description.tags">--tags</a>

The format is very closely modeled after the <a href="https://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/index.html">Matroska specification</a>. Both the binary and the source distributions

         <p>
            The new <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> tagging system only knows two data types, a UTF-8 string and a binary type. The first
            is used for the tag's name and
            the <span class="classname">&lt;String&gt;</span> element while the binary type is used for the <span class="classname">&lt;Binary&gt;</span> element.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            As binary data itself would not fit into a <span class="abbrev">XML</span> file <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) supports two other methods of storing binary data. If the contents of a
            <span class="abbrev">XML</span> tag starts with '<span class="literal">@</span>' then the following text is treated as a file name. The corresponding file's content
            is
            copied into the <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> element.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Otherwise the data is expected to be Base64 encoded. This is an encoding that transforms
            binary data into a limited set of
            <span class="abbrev">ASCII</span> characters and is used e.g. in email programs. <a href="mkvextract.html"><span class="productname">mkvextract</span>(1)</a> will output Base64 encoded data for binary elements.

            Other "segment information" header fields can be set via command line options but
            not via the XML file. This includes e.g. the
            <span class="option"><a href="#mkvmerge.description.title">--title</a></span> and the <span class="option"><a href="#mkvmerge.description.timestamp_scale">--timestamp-scale</a></span> options.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            There are other elements that can be set neither via command line options nor via
            the XML files. These include the following elements:
            <span class="varname">DateUTC</span> (also known as the "muxing date"), <span class="varname">MuxingApp</span>, <span class="varname">WritingApp</span>
            and <span class="varname">Duration</span>. They're always set by <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) itself.
            
         </p>

         <p>
            The <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file layout is quite flexible. <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) will render a file in a predefined way. The resulting file looks like this:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            [EBML head] [segment {meta seek #1} [segment information] [track information] {attachments}
            {chapters} [cluster 1] {cluster 2} ...
            {cluster n} {cues} {meta seek #2} {tags}]
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            The elements in curly braces are optional and depend on the contents and options used.
            A couple of notes:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>
                  meta seek #1 includes only a small number of level 1 elements, and only if they actually
                  exist: attachments, chapters, cues, tags, meta
                  seek #2. Older versions of <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) used to put the clusters into this meta seek element as well. Therefore some imprecise
                  guessing
                  was necessary to reserve enough space. It often failed. Now only the clusters are
                  stored in meta seek #2, and meta seek #1 refers to
                  the meta seek element #2.
                  
               </p>
               
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Attachment, chapter and tag elements are only present if they were added.</p>
               
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p>
            The shortest possible <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> file would look like this:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            [EBML head] [segment [segment information] [track information] [cluster 1]]
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            This might be the case for audio-only files.

         <p>
            <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) allows the user to chose the timestamps for a specific track himself. This can be
            used in order to create files with variable
            frame rate video or include gaps in audio. A frame in this case is the unit that <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1) creates separately per <span class="productname">Matroska</span><sup>(tm)</sup> block. For
            video this is exactly one frame, for audio this is one packet of the specific audio
            type. E.g. for <span class="abbrev">AC-3</span> this would be a
            packet containing <span class="constant">1536</span> samples.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            Timestamp files that are used when tracks are appended to each other must only be
            specified for the first part in a chain of tracks.  For
            example if you append two files, v1.avi and v2.avi, and want to use timestamps then
            your command line must look something like this:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen">$ mkvmerge ... --timestamps 0:my_timestamps.txt v1.avi +v2.avi</pre>
         
         <p>
            There are four formats that are recognized by <span class="productname">mkvmerge</span>(1). The first line always contains the version number. Empty lines, lines
            containing only whitespace and lines beginning with '<span class="literal">#</span>' are ignored.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <h2><a name="d4e6917">16.1. Timestamp file format v1</a></h2>
         
         
         <p>
            This format starts with the version line. The second line declares the default number
            of frames per second.  All following lines contain
            three numbers separated by commas: the start frame (<span class="constant">0</span> is the first frame), the end frame and the number of frames
            in this range. The <span class="abbrev">FPS</span> is a floating point number with the dot '<span class="literal">.</span>' as the decimal point. The ranges
            can contain gaps for which the default <span class="abbrev">FPS</span> is used. An example:
            
         </p>

         <p>
            In this format each line contains a timestamp for the corresponding frame.  This timestamp
            must be given in millisecond precision.  It can
            be a floating point number, but it doesn't have to be.  You <em>have to</em> give at least as many timestamp lines as there
            are frames in the track.  The timestamps in this file must be sorted.  Example for
            25fps:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen"># timestamp format v2

         <h2><a name="d4e6956">16.3. Timestamp file format v3</a></h2>
         
         
         <p>
            In this format each line contains a duration in seconds followed by an optional number
            of frames per second.  Both can be floating point
            numbers.  If the number of frames per second is not present the default one is used.
            For audio you should let the codec calculate the
            frame timestamps itself.  For that you should be using <span class="constant">0.0</span> as the number of frames per second.  You can also create
            gaps in the stream by using the '<span class="literal">gap</span>' keyword followed by the duration of the gap.  Example for an audio file:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="screen"># timestamp format v3

         <h2><a name="d4e6974">16.4. Timestamp file format v4</a></h2>
         
         
         <p>
            This format is identical to the v2 format.  The only difference is that the timestamps
            do not have to be sorted.  This format should
            almost never be used.
