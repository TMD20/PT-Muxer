# **How to Install/Get Started** 
Note I have not had time to test this on windows.
Wine is part of the code, but that is just to run windows software on linux. 

This should run fine on windows with minor changes, but It will require some tecnical know how. 
If you need help I can provide some support until I have time to refactor all the changes required for windows

## Required
  * python modules via requirements.txt 
  * Linux

## Optional Binaries
  These binaries are included but you are free to use newer versions if desired
   see config.py "*LinuxPath"for filepaths. 
  * mkvmerge
  * wine
  * Linux
  * mediainfo



## Recommended

* Installing modules and running python3 via virtualenv
* udevil for non-sudo ISO extractions

### Installing Tesseract
Tesseract allows for many more languages to be ocr, but it does require sudo
and requires packages on the system
The easiest way would just be to follow the instructions in this repo

https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr
This will require sudo

#### Disable tesseract
* Go the project folder
* cd ./subtitles/
* open ocr.py 
* ctrl f "getocr_obj" 
* comment out
```
  try:
        return tesserocr.PyTessBaseAPI(path="/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata", lang=langcodes.Language.get(langcode).to_alpha3())
    except:
        None
    return None
```
now only easyocr will be used.

# Machine Parse

## Subtitles

Subtitles can be ocr with the --ocr command
This will run one of two ocr. The first is better but has fewer languages. 
The second is faster has lots of languages, but in my 
Experience does no ocr as well.

You can utilize this to identify what kind of track the sub is from for. It should work for foreign tracks as a well.


To save the images retrieved for the ocr use the 
--keepocr command 
Every line on the sub will be saved.
However only 50 lines are ocr to save time.

This is very useful for identifing episode as sometimes the last sub image my give a good clue. 
You can also identify dialecs if you want to specificy for the langauge. 
i.e spanish, french etc

## Video
Videorec is not as good as ocr. But it can still kind of be used to ID tracks.
Use the --videorec command to use this feature. 
To save time it will only record about 50 lines worth of the track.

Coming Soon

# Filtering Tracks

## **Note**

I will be provided better details in the future on how to install and run
basically you should make a virtual env, and install all the required modules with the requirements.txt

Windows Support is planned but it might take me a while, and would be done when I feel like the main program is supported

Subtitles will be forced if they have forced anywhere in the site title
