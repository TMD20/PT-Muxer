Most if not all the features of the main branch should be implemented


dgDemux Branch 
* Refactor of code
* Support for dgdemux
* added logging
* added failsafes for clearing program files
* added native subimage processing



Still to do
* Confirm tracks match
* Test multiple sources
* Probably revamp remuxer
