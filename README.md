## **Note**

I will be provided better details in the future on how to install and run
basically you should make a virtual env, and install all the required modules with the requirements.txt

Windows Support is planned but it might take me a while, and would be done when I feel like the main program is supported

Subtitles will be forced if they have forced anywhere in the site title
